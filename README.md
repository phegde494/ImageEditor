# ImageEditor

Run this software in your favorite IDE. 

This program allows you to resize and edit an image of your choice down to the pixel level.

It utilizes a seam carving algorithm which computes the paths of minimum energy cost using Dijkstra's algorithm and dynamic programming. These seams are removed to effectively resize the image. 

Other features include being able to highlight seams as they are removed, generate a grey-scale version of the image to show the seams in a visual format, put seams back to undo edits, change the speed at which the algo runs, and pause/resume cropping. 

Have fun editing!
